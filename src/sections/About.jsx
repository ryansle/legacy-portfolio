        Hello! My name is Ryan Le and I am a senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln majoring in Software Engineering, with a minor in Mathematics.
        Back in August of 2017, I moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, from my hometown of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in order to kickstart my college career
        and learn the ins and outs of software development. Since then, I have learned a lot and have been enjoying every minute of it.
        Now, I am on the search for a full-time web development opportunity!
      </Typography>
      <br />
      <Typography variant="body1">
        So far, I have been enjoying front-end development the most as it allows me to utilize my creative side while
        also leveraging my client-facing abilities to learn how to improve the user experience. Lately, I have been focusing on 
        JavaScript in collaboration with technologies like React.js, Material-UI, and Amazon Web Services (which I am still in the process of learning) to create my projects.

        Throughout my college career, I have gained a variety of experiences in different aspects of leadership and software development.

        Now that I'm a senior at UNL, I am keeping busy with my duties as the Vice President of Communications for the university's Engineering
        Student Advisory Board (a position I was recently elected to), which is the governing body for our school's College of Engineering. Along with that, 
        my friends and I are hard at work on our SOFTie Startup initiative to form a company through our university's senior design program as our capstone
        achievement. 
      </Typography>
      <br />
      <Typography variant="body1">
        Here's how it works: instead of signing on for another year of working for an industry-sponsored project, the university is allowing our 
        assembled team of student developers to pursue our own startup project where we get to be our own primary stakeholders. A project in which we call the shots, 
        define our project vision, incubate our ideas from the ground up, and pursue technologies of interest in a startup environment all with the backing
        of our own tuition dollars, mitigating any and all risk of forming a company from the ground up. Things are going great so far!

        But as busy as my life can be with school, work, and extracurriculars, I can still find time to set aside to do things I love including...
