        I am an incoming senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln majoring in Software Engineering, with a minor in Mathematics. 
        I moved here from Sioux Falls, South Dakota back in August of 2017. Currently, I am working two different software development-based 
        roles over the summer as Software Engineer &amp; Product Manager with Hoffman Strategy Group, and also as an IT
        Software Engineer Intern at Nelnet. After losing my initially planned internship to the ongoing pandemic,
        I shifted gears and decided to take advantage of the remote work opportunity by
        signing on for two separate development opportunities. Things are going great!

      <Typography variant="body1">
        So far, I have been enjoying front-end development the most as it allows me to utilize my creative side while
        also leveraging my client-facing skills. Lately, I have been focusing on JavaScript in collaboration with technologies
        like React.js, Material-UI, Node.js, and Express to create my projects. In the past I've worked
        extensively as well with things like Python, Java, Swift, SwiftUI, and SQL databases. Moving forward, I am specifically interested
        in full-stack development opportunities.

        For the upcoming fall semester, I have been elected to the post of Vice President of Communications for the university's 
        Engineering Student Advisory Board, the governing student body our College of Engineering. Along with that, my
        friends and I within the software engineering major have been working to get our senior year curriculum changed so that
        we can pursue our idea of founding our "SOFTie Startup" through the university's senior design program. And we have just reached our first
        milestone: getting official faculty approval for the improved program pitch.

        This means that, instead of signing on for another year of working for an industry-sponsored project, the university will be allowing our 
        assembled team of students to pursue our own startup project where we get to be our own primary stakeholders. A project in which we call the shots, 
        define our project vision, incubate our ideas from the ground up, and pursue technologies of interest in a startup environment all with the backing
        of our own tuition dollars, mitigating any and all risk of forming a company from the ground up.
