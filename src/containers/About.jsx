          Hello! My name is Ryan Le and I am a senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Software Engineering.
          Back in August of 2017, I moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, from my hometown of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in order to kickstart my college career
          and learn the ins and outs of software development. Since then, I have learned a lot and have been enjoying every minute of it.

        <Typography variant="body1">
          So far, I have been enjoying front-end development the most as it allows me to utilize my creative side while
          also leveraging my client-facing abilities to learn how to improve the user experience. Lately, I have been writing a lot of 
          JavaScript in collaboration with technologies like React.js and Material-UI to create my projects. In time, I'm hoping to pivot and
          gain additional experience in a full-stack environment leveraging tools like Amazon Web Services and the Serverless Framework.
