## Ryan Le's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository containing the code for my personal portfolio! I used Material-UI on top of React.js to create the front-end for this responsive webpage.

### Motivation

- Prepare myself for an upcoming role at Hoffman Strategy Group working as a full-stack software engineer
- Get ready for the upcoming Fall 2020 full-time recruiting season and stand out as an applicant
- Learn new skills while expanding my portfolio by working on a personal project

### Technologies Used

- JavaScript for random site scripting
- React.js for the underlying user interface
- Material-UI for out-of-the-box React.js components
- Redux for global state management
- React-Router for declarative client-side page rendering
- Visual Studio Code as in the integrated development environment
